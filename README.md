# The basic 42Network projects: libft, ft_printf and get_next_line

## Compiling
Once all the prerequisites have been met, you can compile this library by typing:
```
	$ make
```
## üìöLIBFT

### What is libft?

Libft is an individual project at [42][1] that requieres us to re-create some standard C library functions for future projects, and have a deeper understanding of data structures and basic algorithms. At 42 we are not allowed to use some standard libraries on our projects, so we have to keep growing this libary with our own functions as we go farther in the program.

### What's in it?

There are 4 sections:

1.  **Libc Functions:** Some of the standard C functions
2.  **Additional functions:** Functions that will be useful for later projects
3.  **Bonus Functions:** Functions that will be useful for linked list manipulation
4.  **Personal Functions:** Functions I believe will be useful later.

## üìùFT_PRINTF

## What is ft_printf?
Regardless of the programming language considered, the ``printf`` function, (or its equivalents) is always highly useful. The main reason is the ease of its formatting, and the support of diverse types in variable numbers. In short, undeniably, printf is a vital function. In this project, we are ask to recode it and add it to our libft so that we can use it in all of our future projects.

The versatility of the printf function in C represents a great exercise in programming for us. It allow us to discover a feature of the C language ‚Äì variadic functions ‚Äì and to practice detailed management of the printing options.

## üìíGET_NEXT_LINE

## What is get_next_line?
You will understand how files are opened, read and closed in an OS, and how they are interpreted by a programming language for further analysis.
This task is crucial to understand for a future programmer since much of the time is based on manipulating files for data management and persistence.
This project consists of coding a function that returns one line at a time from a text file.
